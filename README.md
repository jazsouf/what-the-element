# what-the-element

### About

The game is about learning about the periodic table of elements.

You are prompted with a symbol from the periodic table and you have to guess the name of the element.

If you guess right, the element is highlited in green and you gain a point. You also get some additionnal info and external link to learn more about the element you just guessed.

If you guess wrong, you are helped with hints. Hints give you help by simplifing the guessing process. For every wrong guess, a letter from the element is revealed, one by one until your guess is correct.

You can skip an element and you can also choose which part of the periodic table you want to play in.
