# What-The-Element?!

### About

The game is about learning the periodic table of elements.

You have to guess the name of every element.

If you guess right, the element is highlited in green and you gain a point.

You also get some additionnal info and external link to learn more about the element you just guessed.

If you guess wrong, you can be helped with hints.

Hints give you help by simplifing the process. A letter from the element is revealed, one by one until your guess is correct.
